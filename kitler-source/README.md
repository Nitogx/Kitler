# Source of the Kitler Programming Language
Welcome to the open-source section of Kitler!

**This contains every file to build your own version of Kitler and see how it works!**

## Requirements
To build Kitler, a system with linux is hugely recommended and atleast 3GB of RAM is recommended.
If you're on Windows, use msys2 or WSL2 with Ubuntu (WSL2 is recommended tho since its a real linux shell instead of msys2)

***Have fun compiling!***
